# City Explorer

**Author**: Christopher Morton/Alexander White
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
I want a user to be able to search by location and get a response back with location

## Getting Started
For a user to build this app they would need to: - Set up their dev enviroment. - Utilize API's, SQL, JavaScript, and the prebuilt front end. - They would need to host their app as well, possibly using a deployment site like Heroku.

## Architecture
The application takes a pre built front end and uses a user built backend to deliver and save data. This is done with JavaScript, SQL, PSQL, as well as th following libraries: express, pg, superagent, cors, and dotenv.

## Change Log
